# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

Contributions are accepted via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/technetist/taskr).

## Filing Issues:

- **Attempt to replicate the problem** - Ensure that it wasn't a coincidental incident.
- **Make sure your feature suggestion isn't already present** - Check for the issue within the project's issues or
  discussion tabs.
- **Ensure that the bug doesn't have a fix in progress** - Check the pull requests tab
  Check the pull requests tab to ensure that the feature isn't already in progress.

## Pull Requests

- **Coding Standards** - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to run `composer lint`.

- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept
  up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle** - This projects follows the semantic versioning scheme. It follows the
  convention `paradigm.major.minor`. Minor releases should never contain breaking changes.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make
  multiple intermediate commits while developing,
  please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages)
  before submitting.

## Running Tests

``` bash
$ ./vendor/bin/pest
```

**Happy coding**!
